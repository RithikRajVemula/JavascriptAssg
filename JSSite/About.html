        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ann Smith. I am a senior in high school. Everyone can agree
            that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects
            are chemistry and biology. I am going to enter the university because my
            goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected
            professional in one of the fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            I consider myself a responsible and hard-working student. Additionally, I am quite sociable and enjoy interacting with others. My circle of friends is diverse, and I cherish the friendships I've built over time. The supportive and friendly atmosphere at school makes my learning experience enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive on challenges and approach tasks with enthusiasm. My friends often describe me as funny and interesting, appreciating my good sense of humor. Building connections with new people brings me joy, especially when we share common interests. Photography is my passion, and it has led me to forge meaningful friendships with like-minded individuals. Capturing moments and sharing them with others brings me immense happiness.
