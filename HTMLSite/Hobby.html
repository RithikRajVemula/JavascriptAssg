                      <p>Everyone has his passion, his own interests. With the excitement, you can do all day long without being bored. Sports are the common favorite of many and football is a popular sport, loved all over the world. Play football for health, fun and entertainment after the stressful hours of work and study. Hobby is the favourite activity, habit when you do regulary in your free time for pleasure and enjoyment. What do you do in free time? My most favourite hobby is playing football in spare time. After completing my home work at home, I generally spend my lot of free time in playing football. I was so interested to play football from my childhood however started learning to play well when I was 5 years old. I was in one class when I was 5 years old. My father asked to my class teacher in the PTM about my hobby of football. And my teacher told him that there is a facility of playing sports daily in the school from class 1 so you can admit your child. Now, I really enjoy playing football and participate in the inter-school competitions.</p>

                      <p>I can proudly said that my interest is the nature; adventure into the wild. Is it sounds cool? Maybe that's what makes many young people love it, because it looks cool. But actually exploring nature is not as easy as it seems from the outside, we need a high dedication to keep do it. Loving the nature is not just about the photos you take and upload into the social media, then everyone will praise and admire you. It is not that guys, not at all about that.
                        Loving the nature is about the extent to which you prove your love to the nature, the extent to which you can understand it, and the extent to which you can understand the language of the nature. Nature often sends messages to us, but our intuition and sensitivity are too dull to understand them. In fact the proving of our love for this universe is not as simple as how they are shown by the photographs.</p>
